# Multiple Apps From One Codebase, Targets inÂ Xcode

Do you have duplicated codebases for very similar applications? Does this process make it difficult for you to fix errors and add innovations? 
Don't worry, Xcode targets can solve this problem for you.

First, let's look at the dictionary definition of Xcode targets; A target in Xcode can be perceived as the blueprint, or more technically, a set of configuration settings that define what to build. 
Each target can specify; Type of Product, Source Files, Build Configurations, Resources. 
Not clear enough? It will become clearer after we see the example we're about to do.

If you've added a watch application, a widget, or a test to your app before, it means you've added a target before. 
Today, by adding an application as a target, we will manage our code for similar applications from a single codebase.
